     * A Batch operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables.
     *
     * The individual `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` operations specified in batch operation are atomic,
     * however, the whole batch operation is not atomic. This means that some puts and deletes can
     * be successful and others can fail.
     *
     * To perform an atomic operation, use `Dyngoose.Transaction`. Additionally, BatchWrites cannot
     * update partial items, however, TransactWrites can.
     *
     * Uses a semaphore to limit parallel writes.
     *
     * @param {DynamoDB} connection You can optionally specify the DynamoDB connection to utilize.
     * @see {@link https://github.com/benhutchins/dyngoose/blob/master/docs/Connections.md}.
